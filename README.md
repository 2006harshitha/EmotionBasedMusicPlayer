Project Title: Emotion-Based Music Player using Computer Vision, Deep Learning & Voice Commands
Description:
This project detects a user's emotion in real-time using webcam input and plays music based on the detected emotion.
It uses DeepFace for emotion analysis, OpenCV for capturing images, Pygame for audio playback, and SpeechRecognition for voice-based controls.
Additionally, it suggests mood-appropriate activities for emotional well-being.
